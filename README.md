PlayFrameworkTemperature
==========================

This is a project purely demonstrative.
It was implemented using **PlayFramework (Java)**, **MaterializeCSS**, **JQuery**, **FlotChart JS**.

The database is based on **MongoDB**, but shortly I will develop the variant with **OrientDB**.

The project is entirely in material design and 100% responsive.

+ To install it, you clone the repository.
+ Go into the folder
+ Write `acvtivator`
+ Waiting for the resolution of dependencies
+ Launch the php script that fills the db whit `php insert_data.php` command
